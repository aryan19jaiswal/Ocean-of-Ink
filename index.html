            <ul>
                <li>There's no point of buying shoes,
                    <br>
                    If you just want to move barefoot.
                </li><br>

                <li>I just hope these girls to be - a real god, a real mother.</li><br>

                <li>You can't beat me & you were never capable of that shit,
                    <br>
                    You were once a fan bitch, who died in the mosh pit.
                </li><br>

                <li>I'm always proud when I see your pictures on those big banners,
                    <br>
                    Cause I know, you were always climbing on those stiff ladders.
                </li><br>

                <li>You have raised bars that are so hard to touch,
                    <br>
                    Easy on yourself, but too hard on us.
                </li><br>

                <li>It was something at first sight, but what I wasn't sure was love,
                    <br>
                    Then you were there all in my mind, and seeing you with someone else became tough.
                </li><br>

                <li>The way you look at stars, is the way I look at you,
                    <br>
                    And at the same time, We both say, oh god, so beautiful!
